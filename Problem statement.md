# Problem Asset – Orbital Mechanics (Laplace–Runge–Lenz Vector)

In Newtonian mechanics, for a particle of negligible mass orbiting a massive body
in an ellipse under Newtonian gravity, you may assume without proof that the vector

$$
\vec{A} = \vec{p} \times \vec{L} - GMm^2 \hat{r}
$$

is conserved.

Here,
- $\vec{p}$ is the particle's momentum,
- $\vec{L}$ is its angular momentum about the massive body,
- $m$ is the particle's mass,
- $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant,
- $M$ is the mass of the massive body,
- $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector pointing from the massive body to the particle.

## (a)
If the direction of the semi-major axis of the orbit is $\hat{x}$, the semi-minor axis is $\hat{y}$, and the orbit lies in the $xy$-plane (so $\hat{z}$ is perpendicular to the orbital plane), find the direction of $\vec{A}$.

Assume that the massive body has a lower $x$-coordinate than the other focus of the ellipse.

## Problem Statement

In Newtonian mechanics, for a particle of negligible mass orbiting a massive body
in an ellipse under Newtonian gravity, you may assume without proof that the vector

$$
\vec{A} = \vec{p} \times \vec{L} - GMm^2 \hat{r}
$$

is conserved.

Here,
- $\vec{p}$ is the particle's momentum,
- $\vec{L}$ is its angular momentum about the massive body,
- $m$ is the particle's mass,
- $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant,
- $M$ is the mass of the massive body,
- $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector pointing from the massive body to the particle.

### (a)
If the direction of the semi-major axis of the orbit is $\hat{x}$, the semi-minor
axis is $\hat{y}$, and the orbit lies in the $xy$-plane, find the direction of
$\vec{A}$. Assume that the massive body has a lower $x$-coordinate than the other
focus of the ellipse.

---

### (b)
Find $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{r}$ in terms of $\vec{p}$, $\vec{L}$, $G$, $M$, $m$, and $r$.
You may use the identity
$$
(\vec{a} \times \vec{b}) \cdot \vec{c}
= (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) \cdot \vec{b}.
$$

---

### (c)
One definition of an ellipse is
$$
r = \frac{ak}{1 + e \cos\theta}.
$$
Find the eccentricity $e$ in terms of $\|\vec{A}\|$ and relevant constants.


---

## (c)
One definition of an ellipse is the set of points that satisfy
$$
r = \frac{ak}{1 + e\cos\theta}.
$$

If $\vec{r}$ is a point on the ellipse and the massive body is located at a focus:
- $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit,
- $ak$ is a constant that determines the size of the ellipse,
- $r=\|\vec{r}\|$,
- $\theta$ is the angle between the semi-major axis and the segment from the focus to the particle.

Find the eccentricity of the orbit in terms of $\|\vec{A}\|$ and relevant constants.
