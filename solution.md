# Solution – Orbital Mechanics

## Laplace–Runge–Lenz Vector

In Newtonian mechanics, the conserved vector is given by
$$
\vec{A} = \vec{p} \times \vec{L} - GMm^2 \hat{r}.
$$

### Part (a): Direction of the vector

At apogee, the particle is farthest from the central mass.
Comparing the centrifugal and gravitational terms shows that
the gravitational contribution dominates, so the vector
$\vec{A}$ points toward periapsis.

### Part (b): Dot product with the position vector

We compute
$$
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{r}
= (\vec{p} \times \vec{L}) \cdot \vec{r} - GMm^2 r.
$$

Using the scalar triple product identity,
$$
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{r} = L^2 - GMm^2 r.
$$

### Part (c): Eccentricity

Comparing with the polar equation of an ellipse gives
$$
e = \frac{A}{GMm^2}.
$$
