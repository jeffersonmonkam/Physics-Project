# Physics Project – Orbital Mechanics


This project studies the motion of a particle in a Newtonian gravitational field,
with a focus on the **Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector** and its physical interpretation.

## Problem overview
For a particle of negligible mass orbiting a massive body under Newtonian gravity,
the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is conserved.  
Using this property, we analyze the geometry of elliptical orbits.

## Main goals
- Determine the direction of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector
- Derive an expression for $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{r}$
- Use this result to find the eccentricity of the orbit
